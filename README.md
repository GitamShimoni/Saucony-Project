# Saucony Project
Welcome to the Saucony Project repository! This project represents my very first foray into web development. Built solely using HTML and CSS, it showcases a collection of brand items inspired by the Saucony brand. As you explore this site, youâ€™ll witness my growth and learning journey since then.
